I was thinking there would be a panel on the right of the "active map."

Minimap:

None.

After re-evaluating the portion of the map a user will see at all times I believe that a minimap would be unneeded and
simply scrolling around would be more user friendly.

Scenario Goals:

The goal button would open up your scenario objective according to what player you are in
that scenario.

Main Menu:

The main menu button would simply take you to the options menu with options to quit, save, or
change settings.

Redo and Undo:

These buttons would allow you to quickly undo whatever your last movement was or replay a 
movement you didnt mean to undo.

Diplomacy and Alliances:

The original rules make a distinction between these two so I decided to make them two separate 
buttons until we have decided otherwise.

The diplomacy button will either take you to the chart or it will simply tell you how close you are
to allying with a neutral.

The Alliances button will remind the player of alliances currently in play if there are any.

End Current Phase:

This button will display the name of the Current Phase and will be how a player progresses 
to the next phase of his turn. It might also remind him of units he has forgotten to move and such.

INFO:

I decided to include some extra information after your suggestion in class such as:

The current Game Turn, any ascendant moons in effect, max game turns for certain scenario, and 
victory points of both you and the highest opponent.
