I was thinking there would be a panel on the right of the "active map."

Minimap:

We need it on the side of the map becasue the swords and sorcery map is longer along the y 
axis than it is along the x so it can't go on the bottom or top without encroaching into 
the active map.

Where you are looking on the active map determines where the square on the minimap is located 
and this square can probably be dragged around to shift where you are lookign on the active
map.

Goals:

The goal button would open up your scenario objective according to what player you are in
that scenario.

Main Menu:

The main menu button would simply take you to the options menu with options to quit, save, or
change settings.

Redo and Undo:

These buttons would allow you to quickly undo whatever your last movement was or replay a 
movement you didnt mean to undo.
