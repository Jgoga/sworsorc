Army combat resutls
Writen by Matt B.
Code Adopted by John G.

This code works with the function PrepareAttackResults.
PrepareAttackResults accepts two ArrayLists of type unit and a hex object

The program calculates the total strength of the two arraylists and then applies the terrain effect. 
 
The result is returned in an array of 2 elements. The first element is the attacker's result and the second 
	element is the defenders result. The possible values are 1-4 for number units that have to retreat/die.
	The value 0 is for no effect and the value -1 is for units eleminated.

A example case is set up with a main file. Open with NetBeans and feel free to run!!!

p.s. To many files to not be opened with NetBeans
