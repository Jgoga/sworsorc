/* A few assorted changes. I aint like a master of class diagrams or anything so 
   some of this could very well be horribly, terrible wrong */
   
/* The MainMap class should be related to DiplomacyMap, again this makes drawing easier
   and streamlines XML loading */
MainMap inherits from HexMap
DiplomacyMap inherits from HexMap

/* From what I can tell the class diagrams are missing a view class for the map.
   Below is just based off of how I've implemented it in Java */
Add MapView to StaticDataStructure (Or somewhere else?). MapView uses a HexMap for drawing.
Add HexDrawer with a user defined association with MapView. MapView uses HexDrawer to draw individual Hexes.
