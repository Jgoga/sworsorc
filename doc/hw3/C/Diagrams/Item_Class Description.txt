Item_Class Diagram
Author: Joe Higley

I read thru the entire rules section on Talismans of Orb.  It separated the Talismans into 2 types, Magicks and Weapons.
So I made these the subclasses of my Talismans of Orbs.  I noticed that the Weapons all changed certain character attributs,
so I made these all private members of the Weapons class that the weapons will all share.

Then I placed all the different weapon and magical talismans as subclasses of the Weapons and Magicks classes respectively.
The individual items have specific members and functions for each of them.
