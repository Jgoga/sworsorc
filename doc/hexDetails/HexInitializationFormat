My idea is that for initializing all hexes with the proper format we can use
the following format for our data file: 

hexID: Terraintype; augmentedTerrain; edge0,edge1,edge2,edge3,edge4,edge5.

With the above delimiters it shouldn't be hard to write a method to initialize
all hexes from a file that lists the hexes like above. I'll begin working on 
that.
