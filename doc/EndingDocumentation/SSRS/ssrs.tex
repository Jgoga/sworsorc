\subsection[IDENTIFICATION]{\rmfamily\bfseries IDENTIFICATION}
\hypertarget{RefHeading15859017292}{}{\itshape
}

{
The system which this document applies is titled Swords and Sorcery, or S \& S for short. It is currently in version 1.0.}

\subsection[PURPOSE]{\rmfamily\bfseries PURPOSE}
\hypertarget{RefHeading16059017292}{}{\itshape
}

{
The purpose of the system under development is to
create a computerized version of the board game Swords and Sorcery. 
While the system will be used by anyone who wants to play the game
, this document is intended to be read and understood
by University of Idaho computer science software designers and coders.}

\subsection[SCOPE]{\rmfamily\bfseries SCOPE}
\hypertarget{RefHeading16259017292}{}{\itshape
}

{
This project began development at the beginning of Spring Semester 2014. As a class
we began by identifying requirements, we then moved onto a brief phase of design before
jumping right into implementation. We have done some testing, but most of this project
is still underdevelopment. This project is sponsored by Dr. Jeffery, and is developed by
the Software Engineering class. Currently the project is able to be ran on any machine
capable of running the Java Virtual Environment.}

\subsection[OVERVIEW AND RESTRICTIONS]{\rmfamily\bfseries OVERVIEW AND
RESTRICTIONS}
\hypertarget{RefHeading16859017292}{}{\itshape
}

{
This document is for limited release only to UI CS personnel working
on the project.}

{
Section 2 of this document describes the system under development
from a holistic point of view. Functions,
characteristics, constraints, assumptions, dependencies, and overall
requirements are defined from the system-level perspective.}


\bigskip

{
Section 3 of this document describes the specific requirements of
the system being developed. Interfaces, features, and specific
requirements are enumerated and described to a degree sufficient
for a knowledgeable designer or coder to
begin crafting an architectural solution to the proposed system.}


\bigskip

{
Section 4 provides the requirements traceability information for the
project. Each feature of the system is indexed by
the SSRS requirement number.}

{
Sections 5 and up are appendices including original information and
communications used to create this document.}

\clearpage\section[OVERALL DESCRIPTION]{\rmfamily\bfseries OVERALL DESCRIPTION}
\hypertarget{RefHeading17059017292}{}{
{\textit{ }}}

\subsection[PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE]{\rmfamily\bfseries PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE}
\hypertarget{RefHeading17259017292}{}{
\foreignlanguage{english}{\textit{ }}}

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
Swords and Sworcery is an independent product and all of it's functions are completely 
self-contained.}

\subsection[PRODUCT FUNCTIONS]{\rmfamily\bfseries PRODUCT FUNCTIONS}
\hypertarget{RefHeading17459017292}{}{\itshape
}

This project's main function is to create a computerized version of the board
game Swords and Sorcery, specifically the army game. This includes the game 
being a multi-player game to be playable over a network. The game functions
are as follows

\begin{itemize}
\item Create/Join a game
\item Play through the different phases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Movement: move units and characters on the board
  \item Combat: complete combat between two different stacks of units
  \item Spell: cast a spell with a character
\end{itemize}
\item Communicate the results of these phases over the network to other instances of the game
\item Communicate with other players through chat over the network
\item End the game
\end{itemize}

\subsection[USER CHARACTERISTICS]{\rmfamily\bfseries USER CHARACTERISTICS}
\hypertarget{RefHeading17659017292}{}{\itshape
}

The intended users of this product are anyone who wants to play the game. The user
should have an education level of at least middle school so they can understand the
rules of the game. They should have some experience of the rules of Swords and Sorcery.
The intended user needs no technical expertise to run this application.

\subsection[CONSTRAINTS]{\rmfamily\bfseries CONSTRAINTS}
\hypertarget{RefHeading17859017292}{}{\itshape
}

Swords and Sorcery is constrained by the rules set by the physical board game. Also due to the networking it is constrained to following the protocols over the network. Hardware requirements are just having enough memory to hold and run Swords and Sorcery, and have the hardware necessary to run the Java Run-Time Environment. 

\subsection[ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES]{\rmfamily\bfseries ASSUMPTIONS AND
DEPENDENCIES}
\hypertarget{RefHeading18059017292}{}{\itshape
}

We assume that the Java Run-Time Environment will be able to run Java 8 code, but if future versions of the Java Run-Time Environment do not support Java 8 code then the Swords and Sorcery code base will need to be updated accordingly.

\subsection[SYSTEM LEVEL (NON{}-FUNCTIONAL) REQUIREMENTS]{\rmfamily\bfseries
SYSTEM LEVEL (NON-FUNCTIONAL) REQUIREMENTS}
\hypertarget{RefHeading18259017292}{}{\itshape
}

\subsubsection[Site dependencies]{\rmfamily\bfseries Site dependencies}
\hypertarget{RefHeading18459017292}{}{
{\textit{ }}
{\textit{ }}}

Swords and Sorcery has very few site dependencies. It requires a mouse and keyboard for input and a monitor for output. To run Swords and Sorcery requires the Java Run Time Environment that can run Java 8 applications. Also the computer needs to have a network connection.

\subsubsection[Safety, security and privacy requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Safety, security and privacy requirements}
\hypertarget{RefHeading18659017292}{}{\itshape
}

Sword and Sorcery had no safety, security, or privacy requirements.

\subsubsection[Performance requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries Performance
requirements}
\hypertarget{RefHeading18859017292}{}{\itshape
}

Swords and Sorcery software application should be able to support up to seven users playing the same
game over the network.

\subsubsection[System and software quality]{\rmfamily\bfseries System and software
quality}
\hypertarget{RefHeading19059017292}{}{\itshape
}

This project shall have the ability to perform all of the required functions with consistent results. Swords and Sorcery shall also be able to be playable on any machine capable of running Java as that is what Swords and Sorcery will run on. It shall also be able to be used by anyone capable of understanding the rules to the board game.


\subsubsection[Packaging and delivery requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries
Packaging and delivery requirements}

\subsubsection[Training{}-related requirements]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Training-related
requirements}
\hypertarget{RefHeading19659017292}{}{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
\foreignlanguage{english}{\textit{ }}\foreignlanguage{english}{ \ \ }}

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
No training materials or expectations are tied to this project other than the limited help screens built into the
software and the rule book for the board game.}

\subsubsection[Logistics{}-related requirements]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black}
Logistics-related requirements}
\hypertarget{RefHeading19859017292}{}{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
}

{The system requirements for Swords and Sorcery are any machine capable of running Java 8 run time environment.}

\subsubsection[Precedence and criticality of requirements]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black}
Precedence and criticality of requirements}
\hypertarget{RefHeading20259017292}{}{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
}

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
All requirements stated above have equal weight, since there are no requirements for safety, security, or privacy all of the requirements were given an equal weight.}

\hypertarget{RefHeading20859017292}{}{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
\foreignlanguage{english}{\ Swords and Sorcery did not require any hardware interfaces.}}

\subsubsection[Software Interfaces]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Software Interfaces}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21059017292}{}{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
\foreignlanguage{english}{\ Swords and Sorcery only required TCP/IP as the only software interface due to needing a network connection.}}

\subsubsection[User Interfaces]{\selectlanguage{english}\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} User Interfaces}
\hypertarget{RefHeading21259017292}{}{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
\foreignlanguage{english}{\ The user interface required for Swords and Sorcery is the Java Run-Time Environment. This is a requirement resulting from the implementation not the design of the project. }}
